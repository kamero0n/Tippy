hi! this is my first solo game jam... and oh boy, it was a ride. so here are some quick learnings, so that for future me, i can have some takeaways as how to improve as an overall designer, programmer, and artist... or maybe just a game dev in general!!

## Learning 1: Keep it simple (gameplay... and maybe everything else)
this feels super obvious, but i definitely was ambitious when it came to making up a game. maybe it was the 2 wk deadline i assumed i could just MAKE a super cool thing. however, my cockiness was definitely beat to a pulp as i realized 2 wks goes by pretty fast, especially when i had other responsibilities/projects i was committed to prior.

near the end, i think i simplified the gameplay WAY too much, and by then, it was a bit too late to keep making changes (or i could've... but i would've expended my lack of sleep by far too much). what i would've done in the future is secure the gameplay early on, but make it so dumb simple AND prototype it. i didn't do this first (which begins the foreshadow of the next learning) and i felt like if i had tried this out first, i could've tweaked and played w/ it more. i also kept switching with top down vs 2d side scroller, when i should've just stuck with one. my indecisive nature was horrific during those 2 weeks, and is DEFINITELY something i need to work on when it comes to creative decisions.

keeping it simple also comes w/ the art, music, and everything else in the game. i just... went too big at first, and i ended up sinking up too much time into art, and not enough everywhere else (another foreshadow of a learning).

overall, keeping things simple not only helps me, but helps solidifies the game's foundations. what is the point of my game? how does the gameplay affect the player's experience? could my game be defined by this gameplay? while i think it depends on the designer's focus of how much of gameplay should impact experience (as audio, visuals, narrative, etc can greatly affect the player's experience), it's definitely a good rule of thumb to keep in mind when it comes to game jams like these or other projects. once you have something simple, building on it is far easier.

## Learning 2: Maybe don't learn a game engine alongside a game jam
this is probably just me, but i thought when joining the game jam "yeah, i mean how HARD is it to learn a new game engine, if i already know another?" (this is because i really wanted to learn/use Godot). um. well past cameron... hard. it's FRICKIN hard. while i don't think Godot is a horrible engine (in fact, it's very nice and i would love to use it more in future games), it definitely has a lot to get used to. and for someone like me, who does take a little bit to get used to something/learn new things, i should've likely tried playing around in the engine BEFORE entering the game jam. would have saved me the hassle of not panicking as i had no clue much of the scenes and interfaces godot has to offer.

similar to how i learned unity, i took time to figure out how to navigate it, and play around. i did NOT do this for godot, and i should've. well, i guess now i did, but from the results of the game jam, i think it shows that i need to take my time with things, and kill my cockiness. i think it's mainly for like game jams, since you really want to focus on making the game, and not so much fighting/learning EVERYTHING about the game engine you are simply using.

i think what i should've done is used unity or use javascript (and just figure out sprite anim imports). all in all, i just need to get used to the basics of any engine before using it for a game jam for my game.

## Learning 3: Don't put your eggs in one basket (is that how that saying goes...)
i had drawn out the characters for my game on a notebook, and i thought it would be fun to see them in pixel art form. i was just learning aesprite, so designing characters in aesprite would be even more fun. and it was! except i had gotten so distracted/into character design, that i honestly neglected much of the design of the rest of the game and the programming for it. this is likely because i was already struggling w/ the engine, i just wanted to be able to do something i sort of knew how to do. it WAS my first time using aesprite, but i got used to it since the documentation was really easy to follow (and there's not too much to it). 

but yeah, i spent too much time on it, wanting to at least make cute characters (although my environment props could DEF use work). i think that's the other thing was over-complicating the environment and characters -- i had such a picture in my head of how i wanted things to look that i did not estimate time correctly nor realize my perfectionism slows me down... significantly. next time, i think i want to be able to cut out time for art AFTER i have the programming down (at least for game jams, to spend my time wisely).

## Learning 4: It should be fun/imposter syndrome sucks 
i think that's what i struggled w/ the most: am i having fun? honestly it felt more relief than fun, and sort of a proving to myself that i can make *something*. however, i know i can do better than the end result, and i think that's because i just... didn't have as much fun. i was stressed.

i also should've just enjoyed what i was making. i don't know if i really did besides the art, and i think that's because i worried i have to make like the BEST game for a game jam ever. or i would see other game developer's projects for other various game jams, and i'd be like "yeah i need to make something on that level." i shouldn't have done that, or compared my skill. it really brought me down, and made it even hard for me to complete the game. i should've had the balance of making it fun for players/others and fun for myself.

## Ending Thoughts
overall, i'm still glad i made a game. is it a good game? absolutely not. however, i made it and that's what matters right now in my journey of being a developer/engineer/designer, and figuring out what i like to do, what's fun or interesting to me, and how little i actually know. there's so many cool things for me to learn not only in programming, but art, and music, and i can't wait to just... learn :)
